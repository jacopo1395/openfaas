# Client
The client.py tries with different number of threads to execute 3 kinds of functions with different computational cost: *Easy*, *Meadium* and *Hard*.

# Run
`python client.py <max_threads> <step_range> <max_difficulty>`


**max_threads**: the maximum number of Threads (range from 1 to max_threads)
<step_range> <max_difficulty>
**step_range**: client.py tries from 1 to max_threads with a step of step_range
<step_range> <max_difficulty>
**max_difficulty**: client.py executes the functions from easy level up to max_difficulty
